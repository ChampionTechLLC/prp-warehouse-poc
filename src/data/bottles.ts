    name: 'Rheinhessen Dornfelder Eiswein 2018',
    description: 'Eiswein is considered the crowning glory of any vintage. What makes it so special is the dense concentration of grape extracts. Frosty conditions freeze the water content within the berry, which ultimately remains in the wine press. The juice then drips into the vats as sweet as honey. Musts with these levels of sugar are difficult for the yeast to process into wine. As a result, Eiswein tends to have very high natural sugar levels, typically exceeding 100 grams per liter.  Yet this tremendous residual sugar still has a refreshing burst of acidity that keeps the wines from being cloying. They are highly popular internationally as both a rarity and specialty.\n\nViolet red in color.  Cherries and fruit drops on the nose.  An expressive, complex and full bodied Eiswein that is easy to drink',

    name: 'Nittardi Augustus 2021',
    description: 'What makes Augustus special is its exceptional production. As was the tradition in the Roman Empire, our wine was also matured in amphorae. These combine the advantages of maturing wines in wooden barrels and stainless steel tanks. Clay amphorae are porous and therefore permeable to air. Like wooden barrels, they therefore allow micro-oxidation. In contrast to wooden barrels, however, they don\'t pass any aromas to the wine.  This favors the production of red wines with dominant primary fruit, as is the case with ageing in stainless steel tanks.\n\nIn our Augustus aromas of dark berries like blackberries appear, typical for the Sangiovese grape. This is the same grape that is also used for great Brunello di Montalcino or Chianti Classico wines. To give the wine more complexity, we decided to create a blend of 70 % Sangiovese and 30 % Cabernet Sauvignon.  The wine becomes particularly harmonious through the Appassimento process, in which the grapes are dried, as in the case of Amarone, in order to concentrate the aromas. Our grapes from the best vineyards were dried for two and a half months and lost about 50% of their liquid.  Following the Appassimento Augustus was matured for 16 months in amphorae that hold about 500 liters. The final polish was given by the subsequent aging in French oak barrels.',

    description: '95% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo Nero and Mammolo.  This Riserva was aged in oak barrels for three years, followed by four more years in the bottle. The wood tones are integrated harmoniously. The wine impresses with its intense bouquet of red fruits, tobacco and vanilla. The taste is dense, structured and shows a balanced, smooth aftertaste of soft tannins and rich aromas of cherries and plum. Fine spice, fruit compote, fully ripe plums, perfectly matured fruit acidity, juiciness and compact stature are perfectly balanced - pure Tuscany.  The ageing potential of this wine is approx. 10-15 years.',
